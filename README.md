This repository contains the complete source code for the Extended Research Project submitted as part of the MSc in Data Science. Due to data privacy constraints, the datasets and trained models used in this project are not included.

All relevant code is provided in the Datel_Project_code.ipynb notebook. Output cells have been intentionally cleared to prevent rendering issues and to safeguard sensitive information. The notebook is designed to run seamlessly in Google Colab, utilizing L4 GPU acceleration and integrated with Google Drive for storage and access.

**Prototype Demonstration**  
You can view the video demonstration of the prototype on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PkeEPrntjPpSI7pB1yTZGgUgnQAlC7KT/view?usp=sharing).
